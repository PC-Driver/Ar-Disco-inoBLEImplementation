# STM32duinoBLE

This library is a fork of ArduinoBLE library to add the support of STBTLE-RF and STBTLE-1S BLE modules.
It was successfully tested with the X-NUCLEO-IDB05A1 expansion board and a NUCLEO-F401RE or NUCLEO-L476RG or
NUCLEO-L053R8, with B-L475E-IOT01A and with STEVAL-MKSBOX1V1.
In order to use this library with STEVAL-MKSBOX1V1, you need to update the firmware of the STBTLE-1S BLE module
mounted on that board as described in the following wiki page:
